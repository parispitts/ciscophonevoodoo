The 7962 and 7942 appear to be very similar with respect to what is needed to get them up and working in the SIP environment.

You should have the following files in the TFTP directory
  1. term62.default.loads
  2. term42.default.loads
  3. SIP42.9-4-2SR2-2S.loads
  4. jar42sip.9-4-2ES22.sbn
  5. dsp42.9-4-2ES22.sbn
  6. cvm42sip.9-4-2ES22.sbn
  7. cnu42.9-4-2ES22.sbn
  8. apps42.9-4-2ES22.sbn
  9. a config file which starts with "SEP", has the MAC address of you phone and ends with .cnf.xml.

Files 1-8 are standard what you download from the Cisco support site; File 9 is specific to your phone. The MAC on my phone is 0021A02CED4E, so I have an xml file in the TFTP directory that is named SEP0021A02CED4E.cnf.xml. Reference the example .cnf.xml file 

(The load Information model seems to work fine for the 7942 and 7962 as written); as you load new versions of software, you will need to update the loadInformation element of the xml file each time. 

Reset the phone to factory by holding down the pound (#) key as it boots up. Once the six amber lights on the right of the phone start alternating, release the # key, and enter 123456789*0#. (not all at once, one after the other). The phone should reset.

As the phone boots up, you should see the files being pushed from the TFTP server to the phone. Check your TFTP logs to make sure the files are getting there.
