The 7962 and 7942 appear to be very similar with respect to what is needed to get them up and working in the SIP environment.

You should have the following files in the TFTP directory
  1. term62.default.loads
  2. term42.default.loads
  3. SIP42.9-4-2SR2-2S.loads
  4. jar42sip.9-4-2ES22.sbn
  5. dsp42.9-4-2ES22.sbn
  6. cvm42sip.9-4-2ES22.sbn
  7. cnu42.9-4-2ES22.sbn
  8. apps42.9-4-2ES22.sbn

Reset the phone to factory by holding down the pound (#) key as it boots up. Once the six amber lights on the right of the phone start alternating, release the # key, and enter 123456789*0#. (not all at once, one after the other). The phone should reset.

As the phone boots up, you should see the files being pushed from the TFTP server to the phone. Check your TFTP logs to make sure the files are getting there.
